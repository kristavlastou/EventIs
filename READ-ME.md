# EventIs - Social Events Web Application

This is a group project where we developed a web application using **JSP** files and **Java**. The application serves as a platform for searching and publishing social events.

## Description
The platform allows users to explore a wide range of social events, including:
- Parties
- Concerts
- Theaters
- Cinema
- Festivals
- Exhibitions
- Performances
- Sports events

Users of the application have two main functionalities:
1. **Event Organizers:** Users can create and publish their own events by providing essential details such as:
   - Event name
   - Category
   - Date & time
   - City & exact location
   - Ticket price (if applicable)
   - Event description

2. **Event Seekers:** Users can search and save events based on their preferences, availability, and location.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to create an **online socialization platform** that encourages users to discover new events, meet people with similar interests, and enrich their social life.
